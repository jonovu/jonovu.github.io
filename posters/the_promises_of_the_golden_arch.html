                <h2>Employee Job Functions</h2>
                <p>This chapter lists out the basic job functions and responsibilities of each worker position.</p>

                <p>Drive-Thru Responsibilities 1st Window (Pay Here): Training should provide you a basic understanding of where each menu item is located on the register. When taking an order, you should:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Greet the customer (Example: Welcome to McDonald’s, may I take your order?).</li>
                    <li>Take the order (asking every once in a while, anything else? or will that be all?)</li>
                    <li>When the customer is finished ordering, verify their order is correct (Example: Is your order correct on the screen?) by having them read their order on the screen as in the picture shown on the right. This is especially important if they added specifications to their order.</li>
                    <li>Tell the customer their total and say Thank You. </li>
                </ol>

                <p>When the customer arrives at your window:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Greet them again (Example: Hello, how are you sir/ma’am?) with a smile.</li>
                    <li>During rush hours, it’s very convenient to repeat the order to the customer, so as to not charge them wrong.</li>
                    <li>Repeat their total.</li>
                    <li>Charge their order</li>
                    <li>Return their change/card and their receipt and give them a farewell (Example: Have a nice day!)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>2nd Window (Pick-Up Here) - Training should provide you basic understanding of how the screens displaying orders work and what buttons you should press and so on. For each order, you should:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all the drinks (These include: fountain drinks, McCafe drinks, milkshakes, McFlurries, milks, juice boxes)</li>
                    <li>Greet the customer (Example: Hello, how are you?) with a smile. A customer should verify their order is correct</li>
                    <li>Tell them what their drinks are and hand them to the customers (if you repeat their order, the customer will know if the order was taken wrong and you can fix it at the window).</li>
                    <li>Gather the food bag. Check to make sure all the food is in the bag. It is your responsibility that all the food is in the bag before handing it to the customer.</li>
                    <li>Repeat their food order briefly (Example: cheeseburgers and a fry) while handing them their bag (again this would clarify any mistakes when their order was taken) with a smile as shown in the picture to the right. NOTE: You risk losing your job if you give away any free food or drinks, Happy Meal toys or any other products.</li>
                    <li>Say Thank You and give them a farewell.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Kitchen Reponsibilities:</h3>
                <p>A working kitchen should have a minimum of two cooks (refer to diagram on next page).</p> 
                <p>1st Cook (#1 on diagram) - You are responsible for beginning the assembly of the food. Typically, you:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Toast the bread products</li>
                    <li>Get the paper wrap for the food</li>
                    <li>Put all the condiments, vegetables, and/or cheeses on the bread (making any modifications if the customer has a special order).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>2nd Cook (#2 on diagram) - You are responsible for finishing the assembly of the food. Typically, you:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the meat/chicken</li>
                    <li>Wrap the food</li>
                    <li>Send it to the heated landing pad.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>3rd Cook (#3 on diagram) - Sometimes there is a 3rd cook during rush hours. Typically, you only:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook meat/chicken (essentially restocking)</li>
                    <li>Restock condiments</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Hand them their order with a smile!</p>
                <p>NOTE: This is the typical assembly line for burgers/sandwiches. This process differs for salads, McWraps, etc. We provide the process for the burgers/sandwiches because you’ll be using this process the most.</p>

                <h3>Customer Service Lobby Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Cashiering - Working a cash register grants you certain responsibilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are responsible for having enough the correct amount of cash in your register by the end of your shift (meaning you are not short on money)</li>
                    <li>You must greet a customer when they walk in the restaurant</li>
                    <li>It’s preferable to repeat the customer’s order to verify the order is correct.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for giving the customer their complete order. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Money Handling - You are responsible for depositing your cash profits in the safe at the end of your shift. Training should educate you on how to properly deposit and leave $100 on the register.</p>
                <p>Lobby clean up - Throughout the day, you will be asked to check the lobby. This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sweeping (if necessary)</li>
                    <li>Wiping down tables </li>
                    <li>Returning dirty trays to the back</li>
                    <li>Light Mopping (if necessary)</li>
                    <li>Checking the trash cans (if they’re full, change the bag) At the end of your shift, you are responsible for giving a thorough clean to the whole lobby and bathrooms. You are also responsible for restocking all the cups, condiments, lids, etc. for the front.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Managerial Responsibilities:</h3>
                <p> Organizing Crew Members - It is your responsibility to have a working number of staff numbers to operate the restaurant. You must accommodate if you will be missing any workers. If you do not find replacements or rearrange your workers, you will struggle throughout the day, especially during rush hours. You are expected to place employees in positions that you know will do their best in (Example: You know one employee is fast and is good at memorizing orders, so he/she should be placed at the 2nd Drive-Thru Window).</p>
                <p>Customer Complaints - Training should educate on the proper process for documenting a customer complaint. Your coworkers should also know how to handle and alert you when a customer wants to file a complaint.</p>
                <p>Money Handling - You are also responsible for ensuring that your coworkers make their deposits correctly. If you are the closing manager, you need to ensure that the day’s profits are complete and stored in the store safe. Training should provide you the basic knowledge on your restaurant’s computer system to document the day’s profits. </p>

                <h2>Sexual Harassment in the Workplace</h2>
                <p>McDonald’s Sexual Harassment Policy McDonald’s strongly believes that all employees and applicants for employment should be treated fairly and without regard to race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, disability, veteran’s status sexual orientation or any other prohibited basis. This applies to all employment practices, including recruiting, hiring, pay, performance reviews, training and development, promotions and other terms and conditions of employment.</p>
                <p>Discrimination of harassment of a McDonald’s employee, whether by another employee, supplier, vendor or customer, will not be tolerated. McDonald’s will not tolerate any form of harassment, joking remarks, or other abusive conduct (including verbal, non-verbal, or physical conduct) that demeans or shows hostility toward an individual because of his/her race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age disability, veteran status, sexual orientation or other prohibited basis and that creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment, unreasonably interferes with an individual’s work performance or otherwise adversely affects an individual’s employment opportunities. McDonald’s has ZERO tolerance for any form of sexual harassment of any employee, whether male or female. Sexual harassment is prohibited because it may be intimidating, an abuse of power, and is inconsistent with McDonald’s policies, practices and management philosophy. All employees are required to adhere to McDonald’s policy prohibiting discrimination and harassment while on McDonald’s premises, engaging in work-related activities, company sponsored training or other functions and at non-company activities when conduct at these would affect the work environment.

                <h3>Procedure on How to Report Sexual Harassment</h3>
                <p>All McDonald’s employees hold the right to stop discriminatory, harassing and/or offensive behavior directing towards him/her. McDonald’s encourages employees to freely report incidents of discrimination or harassment without fear of reprisal. McDonald’s prohibits retaliation against any employee who has made a complaint about harassment or discrimination or has cooperated in the investigation of such a complaint. Retaliation includes any employment decision or other conduct made with the intent to punish an employee for complaining about or assisting in the investigation of discrimination or harassment.

Management employees who witness or receive reports of discriminatory or harassing behavior are required to immediately report these events to the Area Supervisor or Owner. Management employees who fail to make the report may be subject to discipline.</p>

                <h3>Sexual Harassment Consequences</h3>
                <p>McDonald’s will investigate your report thoroughly, keeping confidentiality. If the investigation uncovers that sexual harassment was in play, McDonald’s will take disciplinary action against the offender ranging from a warning to termination. Sexual Harassment towards the Customer McDonald’s employees are prohibited from discriminating against or harassing customers, suppliers and vendors, based on race, color, sex, religion, natural origin, disability, sexual orientation or any other unlawful reason, both in the course of work related activities and at company-sponsored training or functions.

                <h2>Employee Job Functions</h2>
                <p>This chapter lists out the basic job functions and responsibilities of each worker position.</p>

                <p>Drive-Thru Responsibilities 1st Window (Pay Here): Training should provide you a basic understanding of where each menu item is located on the register. When taking an order, you should:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Greet the customer (Example: Welcome to McDonald’s, may I take your order?).</li>
                    <li>Take the order (asking every once in a while, anything else? or will that be all?)</li>
                    <li>When the customer is finished ordering, verify their order is correct (Example: Is your order correct on the screen?) by having them read their order on the screen as in the picture shown on the right. This is especially important if they added specifications to their order.</li>
                    <li>Tell the customer their total and say Thank You. </li>
                </ol>

                <p>When the customer arrives at your window:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Greet them again (Example: Hello, how are you sir/ma’am?) with a smile.</li>
                    <li>During rush hours, it’s very convenient to repeat the order to the customer, so as to not charge them wrong.</li>
                    <li>Repeat their total.</li>
                    <li>Charge their order</li>
                    <li>Return their change/card and their receipt and give them a farewell (Example: Have a nice day!)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>2nd Window (Pick-Up Here) - Training should provide you basic understanding of how the screens displaying orders work and what buttons you should press and so on. For each order, you should:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all the drinks (These include: fountain drinks, McCafe drinks, milkshakes, McFlurries, milks, juice boxes)</li>
                    <li>Greet the customer (Example: Hello, how are you?) with a smile. A customer should verify their order is correct</li>
                    <li>Tell them what their drinks are and hand them to the customers (if you repeat their order, the customer will know if the order was taken wrong and you can fix it at the window).</li>
                    <li>Gather the food bag. Check to make sure all the food is in the bag. It is your responsibility that all the food is in the bag before handing it to the customer.</li>
                    <li>Repeat their food order briefly (Example: cheeseburgers and a fry) while handing them their bag (again this would clarify any mistakes when their order was taken) with a smile as shown in the picture to the right. NOTE: You risk losing your job if you give away any free food or drinks, Happy Meal toys or any other products.</li>
                    <li>Say Thank You and give them a farewell.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Kitchen Reponsibilities:</h3>

                </ol>
                <p>3rd Cook (#3 on diagram) - Sometimes there is a 3rd cook during rush hours. Typically, you only:</p>

                    <li>Restock condiments</li>

                <h3>Customer Service Lobby Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Cashiering - Working a cash register grants you certain responsibilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are responsible for having enough the correct amount of cash in your register by the end of your shift (meaning you are not short on money)</li>
                    <li>You must greet a customer when they walk in the restaurant</li>
                    <li>It’s preferable to repeat the customer’s order to verify the order is correct.</li>
                    <li>You are responsible for giving the customer their complete order. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Money Handling - You are responsible for depositing your cash profits in the safe at the end of your shift. Training should educate you on how to properly deposit and leave $100 on the register.</p>
                <p>Lobby clean up - Throughout the day, you will be asked to check the lobby. This means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sweeping (if necessary)</li>
                    <li>Wiping down tables </li>
                    <li>Returning dirty trays to the back</li>

                    <li>Checking the trash cans (if they’re full, change the bag) At the end of your shift, you are responsible for giving a thorough clean to the whole lobby and bathrooms. You are also responsible for restocking all the cups, condiments, lids, etc. for the front.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Managerial Responsibilities:</h3>
                <p> Organizing Crew Members - It is your responsibility to have a working number of staff numbers to operate the restaurant. You must accommodate if you will be missing any workers. If you do not find replacements or rearrange your workers, you will struggle throughout the day, especially during rush hours. You are expected to place employees in positions that you know will do their best in (Example: You know one employee is fast and is good at memorizing orders, so he/she should be placed at the 2nd Drive-Thru Window).</p>
                <p>Customer Complaints - Training should educate on the proper process for documenting a customer complaint. Your coworkers should also know how to handle and alert you when a customer wants to file a complaint.</p>
                <p>Money Handling - You are also responsible for ensuring that your coworkers make their deposits correctly. If you are the closing manager, you need to ensure that the day’s profits are complete and stored in the store safe. Training should provide you the basic knowledge on your restaurant’s computer system to document the day’s profits. </p>
